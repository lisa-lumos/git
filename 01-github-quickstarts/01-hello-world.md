# Hello World

## branch
By default, your repo has one branch named main, that is considered to be the definitive branch. You can create additional branches off of main. 

You can use branches to have different versions of a project at one time. This is helpful when you want to add new features to a project, without changing the main source of code. The work done on different branches will not show up on the main branch, until you merge it.

When you create a branch off the main branch, you're making a copy of main, as it was at that point in time. If someone else made changes to the main branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.

You edit files/folders, and make comments to a branch. 

## Open a pull request
When you make a pull request, you're proposing your changes, and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution, and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show differences of the content from both branches. The changes/additions/subtractions are shown in different colors.

As soon as you make a commit, you can open a pull request and start a discussion, even before the code is finished.

By using GitHub's `@mention` feature in your pull request message, you can ask for feedback from specific people/teams.

In the pull request description, you can include emojis/images/gifs.

Optionally, to the right of your title and description, click the gear next to Reviewers/Assignees/Labels/Projects/Milestone, to add any of these options to your pull request. These options offer different ways to collaborate using pull requests. 

## Merge your pull request
In this final step, you will merge your branch into the main branch. After you merge your pull request, the changes on your branch will be incorporated into `main`.

Sometimes, a pull request may introduce changes to code, that conflict with the existing code on main. If there are any conflicts, GitHub will alert you about the conflicting code, and prevent merging, until the conflicts are resolved. You can make a commit that resolves the conflicts, or use comments in the pull request, to discuss the conflicts with your team members.

Now that your pull request is merged and your changes are on main, you can safely delete the branch. If you want to make more changes to your project, you can always create a new branch and repeat this process.
