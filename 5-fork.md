# Git Learning Notes - Part 5

## Fork

Forking can make a complete copy of someone else's repo, then you can fork to local machine to make any changes to it. 

After testing, you can push it back to your fork,  then can create a PR (pull request) against the original repo. 

A pull request – also referred to as a merge request – is an event that takes place in software development when a contributor/developer is ready to begin the process of merging new code changes with the main project repository.
