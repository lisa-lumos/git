# 3. Git branching
## 3.1 Branches in a Nutshell
Branching means you diverge from the main line of development, and continue to do work without messing with that main line.

The way Git branches is incredibly lightweight, making branching operations nearly instantaneous, and switching back and forth between branches generally just as fast. 

Unlike many other VCSs, Git encourages workflows that branch and merge often, even multiple times in a day.
